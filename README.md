# Jarvis

Short 1-2 sentence summary describing what this project does and why it matters.

---

## 🌍 Motivation

Why this problem is important, and what real-world context it fits into.

> Example: "Rising turbidity affects aquatic ecosystems and drinking water. This model estimates river turbidity from satellite data to support monitoring and management."

## 🧠 Methods

- Describe the ML/DS approach (e.g., CNN, GNN, LSTM)
- Mention the data sources and preprocessing strategy
- If applicable, explain geospatial or time-series aspects

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL), FastAPI, Docker  
- Planet Imagery, Google Earth Engine  
- SLURM, Shell scripting, scikit-learn
